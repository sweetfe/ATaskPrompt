# TaskCat Architecture Summary

## Project Overview

TaskCat is an ADHD/AU-friendly task management application designed to encourage task completion through positive reinforcement rather than traditional notifications. The app uses popups, swipe gestures, and reward systems to make task completion engaging and satisfying. It works on both web and Android platforms.

## Architecture Summary

### Core Components

The application is structured around several key components:

- **TaskList**: Manages and displays tasks with context/mode support
- **TaskPrompt**: Shows random positive task prompts
- **TaskSwipe**: Enables swipe-based task selection
- **RewardAnimation**: Handles visual and auditory rewards with multilingual support
- **TrophyBoard**: Displays earned achievements
- **TaskDetails**: Shows detailed information about tasks associated with trophies
- **TaskSearch**: Provides search functionality for tasks with edit capabilities
- **LoadingIndicator**: Shows loading states during operations

### Data Management

The app uses Firebase Firestore for cloud storage with offline support through localStorage. Data models include Tasks, Trophies, User Settings, and Task History. The storage system has been enhanced to properly handle Date objects when saving and loading data.

### User Experience

The UI/UX design focuses on:
- Positive phrasing in all interactions
- Minimal distractions and clean interface
- Clear visual feedback for all actions
- Accessibility features for diverse needs
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Context/mode-based task organization

### Key Features

1. **Popup System**: Replaces traditional notifications with engaging prompts
2. **Swipe Gestures**: Intuitive task selection through swipe actions
3. **Reward System**: Multi-modal rewards including visual (confetti), auditory (sounds), and achievement (trophies) elements with multilingual congratulation messages
4. **Trophy Board**: Achievement tracking to maintain motivation with custom trophy images and progression system
5. **Task Details View**: Tap on trophies to view associated task information
6. **Task Search**: Search functionality to find specific tasks by text or category with edit capabilities
7. **Context/Mode System**: Organize tasks by contexts/modes instead of geolocation
8. **Android Notifications**: Native notification support for priority and date-specific tasks
9. **Bill Payment Reminders**: Specialized alerts for financial tasks
10. **Offline Support**: Full offline functionality with automatic sync

### Technical Implementation

- **Frontend**: React with Vite for fast development
- **Styling**: Custom CSS for responsive design
- **State Management**: React Context API and custom hooks
- **Animations**: canvas-confetti for visual effects
- **Gestures**: react-swipeable for swipe functionality
- **Storage**: Firebase Firestore with localStorage fallback
- **Authentication**: Firebase Authentication with Google Sign-in
- **Mobile**: Capacitor for Android native features
- **Notifications**: Capacitor Local Notifications for Android alerts
